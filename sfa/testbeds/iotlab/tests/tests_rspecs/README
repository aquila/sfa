Rspec file names
======================
Rspec file names are constructed as follows :
	 slice name used in this rspec + network in which the reserved nodes are

Networks can be : iotlab, plab, all (iotlab + plab)
	
Slices and users
=================
user:
login iotlab : user
hrn iotlab: iotlab.user
hrn firexp: firexp.flab.iotlab_user
slice iotlab: iotlab.user_slice
slice firexp : firexp.flab.iotlab_slice


This special test  user comes from Firexp and is considered as an
external user coming from a federated testbedd for Iotlab.

user:
login iotlab: avakian
slice iotlab: iotlab.avakian_slice
hrn firexp : firexp.flab.avakian (?)
slice firexp : firexp.flab.avakian_slice (?)

This user comes from iotlab. 


Leases
======

The starting time of the leases in those RSpec files are
usually set to be in 2014, so that we don't have to keep the
date in mind and check that we are not scheduling a lease
in the past.
